# pazaak-gbc
The pazaak minigame from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, recreated for the Game Boy Color.

Very much still a work in progress.

[Initial code based on this tutorial](https://gb-archive.github.io/salvage/tutorial_de_ensamblador/tutorial_de_ensamblador%20%5BLa%20decadence%5D.html)

### Building the ROM

Install [RGBDS](https://github.com/rednex/rgbds) on your system, then just run the makefile.

I recommend using [BGB](http://bgb.bircd.org/) to run it, as it's generally considered to be the most accurate emulator.
