# pazaak-gbc
The pazaak minigame from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, recreated for the Game Boy Color.

Very much still a work in progress.

[Initial code based on this tutorial](http://wiki.ladecadence.net/doku.php?id=tutorial_de_ensamblador)

## Building the ROM

Install [RGBDS](https://github.com/rednex/rgbds) on your system, then just run the makefile.

I recommend using [BGB](http://bgb.bircd.org/) to run it, as it's generally considered to be the most accurate emulator.
